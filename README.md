# karaoke

## motivation
i created this because sometimes i just wanna see lyrics on the edge of my window so I don't have to embarrass myself and sing the wrong thing when i'm listening to music in the background :metal:

## to test
1. run `yarn build` in your terminal 
2. go to `chrome://extensions` in chrome
3. turn "Developer mode" is on
4. load the extension by linking to the build directory that was created from step 1
5. try it out!

## react
this project was bootstrapped with [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
